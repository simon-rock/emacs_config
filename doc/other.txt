about usage of git 
issue:
    You asked to pull from the remote 'origin', but did not specify
    a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
    for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line
    
    add config to .git/config
        [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
